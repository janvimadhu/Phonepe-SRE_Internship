Tasks for Week 3 : Topic : Network basics
 
1. Bridge connectivity or L2 connectivity:
- Create two VMs, assign an IP from the same /24 subnet and establish connectivity between those two VMs
Test for connectivity: two VMs should be able to ping each other

What was done
Configuration in virtual box:
1. Assign an adapter to each of the VM
2. Select internal network and allot a name for the network
3. Note that for only 2 VMs to communicate they should be in the same internal network.
4. Start the VM open /etc/netplan/*.yaml file
5. Under the enabled adapter in virtual box (Name of adapters - enp0s3, enp0s8, enp0s9, enp0s10.                                                                                network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
     dhcp4: no
     addresses: [192.168.1.2/24]
     nameservers:
       addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]

2. L3 Connectivity:
- Create 3 VMs and establish connectivity in following manner,
VM1 <-> VM2
VM3 <-> VM2
VM1<->VM3 ( via VM2 as router )
Test: same as #1

What was done: 
Static Routing
1. Same as task1 and add a router VM
2. Add an extra adapter to the VM and set one the adapters IP as the default gateway for each of the VMs that are present in two different networks separated by the router.
Virtual box configuration
Router VM : adapter1 - network one ==> ip : 192.168.1.1/24
                     adapter2 - network two ==> ip : 192.168.2.1/24
VM1 : adapter1 - network one ==> default gateway is 192.168.1.1  
VM2 : adapter1 - network two ==> default gateway is 192.168.2.1,  

3. NAT on router VM
-Create 3 VMs and connect them as #2
-Router VM (i.e VM2) will accept connections on its own IP and port 2222 and forward the packets to VM3 on port 22
example: 
VM1 connects to  VM2 port 2222
VM2 forwards the traffic to VM3 port 22
Result, VM1 is connected to VM3`s port 22 ( via VM2`s port 2222)

What was done:
The Forwarding is done by router so the commands are executed on the router VM.
1. sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 2222 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.2:22 ==> forwards anything coming to the router port 2222 to the address 192.168.2.2 to port 22 
2. sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.2.2 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
3. This is not persistent… to make it persistent install iptables-persistent and then execute the above 2 commands later save it using the given below commands                                                                                    sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
      sudo nano /etc/iptables/rules.v4
     sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

4. Dynamic routing
- Implement #2 and #3, with BGP as routing ( using software FRR ) , and run the same tests as of #2 and #3

What was done:

1. Installation followed by https://youtu.be/44teasemBr4
2. BGP configuring done by https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJqb_j53o7BiVPaFGQxEHhGx-ximMukwH
3.  

5. Create 4 VMs
- Connect them as #2 
- Install Librenms in one of the VM and setup monitoring of other 3 VMs

What was done:

1. Monitor Vm was created along with 3 VMs to be monitored.
2. Installed snmpd in all the 4 VM
3. Then configure the snap file as mention in the link https://www.eventsentry.com/kb/281
4. Now install gui in the monitor VM. https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-a-gui-on-ubuntu
5. Install librenms as shown in https://docs.librenms.org/Installation/Install-LibreNMS/
